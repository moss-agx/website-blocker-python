# website-blocker-python
simple code to block websites.
We're all aware that when we're surfing the web, a slew of unwanted websites pop up to divert our attention. This project can be useful in such situations because it can be set up to prevent certain websites from loading. The programme is useful for people who are easily distracted and switch to social media sites while working on a serious project.
